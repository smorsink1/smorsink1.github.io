	<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
	<p>Here are the Nascargraphs playoff projections. Using historical and current seasons performance of each driver and team, we generate a probability of making the playoffs for each driver.</p>
	<p>How to interpret these projections: If a driver's playoff probability is 75%, that means that if you were to play out the rest of the season a large number of times, the driver would make the playoffs roughly 3 out of every 4 times.</p>
	<p>How not to interpret these projections: If a driver's playoff probability is above 50%, that does not mean that they're going to make the playoffs. By the same token, if a driver's playoff probability is less than 50%, that doesn't mean that they will miss the playoffs. Every day, a ton of events with less than a 50% chance of happening happen, and a ton of events with a greater than 50% chance of happening don't happen. Also, you'll notice that the table below does not include rankings. This is intentional: a driver in 16th place with a 51% playoff probability has basically the exact same chance of making the playoffs as a driver in 17th place with a 50% probability. The playoff probabilities take into account the number of remaining playoff spots: just because a driver's playoff probability is in the top 16 does not mean that the driver will make the playoffs. </p>
