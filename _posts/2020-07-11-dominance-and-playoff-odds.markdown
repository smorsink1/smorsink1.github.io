### Kevin Harvick and Denny Hamlin's dominance has taken away opportunities for wins, but hasn't had a big effect on other drivers' playoff odds.

(Thanks to https://www.racing-reference.info for the raw data)

Kevin Harvick and Denny Hamlin have dominated the NASCAR Cup Series since the season restart in May. The two have won 7 of the 12 races since the restart, and four of the last 5, swapping first and second place finishes at Pocono two weekends ago.

The dominance has been historic, and what could have transpired last weekend at the Brickyard makes their dominance even starker. An ill-timed blown tire likely cost front-running Hamlin the win, with Harvick instead picking up the victory. Had Hamlin and Harvick finished 1-2 for the third consecutive race, they would have become only the 11th unique set of drivers to finish 1-2 in three consecutive races (and the first since Mark Martin finished runner up to Jeff Gordon in 3 consecutive races in 1998).*

But what about the rest of the field? Now in the second half of the regular season, mid-pack drivers are jockeying for playoff spots. Race wins are extremely valuable commodities, as they virtually guarantee a playoff berth. With every race won by a Harvick or Hamlin, mid-pack drivers lose the chance to grab a playoff spot.

But, using Nascargraphs performance-only playoff odds, we don't observe much of a change in the playoff chances of mid-pack drivers. In fact, the median difference in playoff odds is virtually zero for a mid-pack driver from before the Dixie Vodka 400 race at Homestead Miami (a race won by Hamlin, setting off a five race stretch in which Hamlin and Harvick combined for four wins) to after the Big Machine Hand Sanitizer 400 at the Brickyard.

Here are the changes in playoff odds from before the Homestead race to after the Brickyard race (for drivers that entered that period with at least a 20% chance of making the playoffs and without a win):

| Driver | Change in Playoff Probability |
| --- | --- |
| Ryan Blaney | +25% |
| Aric Almirola | +20% |
| Kyle Busch | -1% |
| Kurt Busch | -1% |
| Matt DiBenedetto | +4% |
| Clint Bowyer | -2% |
| William Byron | +7% |
| Jimmie Johnson | -13% |
| Austin Dillon | +3% |
| Erik Jones | -7% |
| Tyler Reddick | 0% |
| Bubba Wallace | +2% |
| Ricky Stenhouse, Jr. | +2% |
| Chris Buescher | -6% |
| John Hunter Nemechek | -1% |

Of course, some drivers have helped their case: Ryan Blaney virtually locked up a playoff spot with a victory at Talladega, and Aric Almirola has been on a tear in this five-race stretch, finishing 3rd three times and 5th twice. But the median of the change in playoff probabilities listed above is 0%.

So what's going on? It's true that Harvick and Hamlin are taking opportunities for wins away from mid-pack drivers, and that those wins are potentially very valuable for making the playoffs. Why aren't their playoff odds dropping?

The answer is that the past five races have gone pretty much as expected, with one big caveat. For the purposes of playoff odds, it is mainly important whether a race is won by a new race winner (for example Ryan Blaney winning at Talladega) or by someone who has already won. Yes, Kevin Harvick winning at the Brickyard takes a chance for a win away from a mid-pack driver, but so too would a win by Alex Bowman (who picked up a win pre-pandemic shutdown at Fontana).

Baked into the pre-Homestead playoff odds is an understanding that some of the upcoming races were likely to be won by drivers that have already won a race. And that is exactly what happened! It just so happens that the past five races have featured a stretch of dominance by two drivers. In terms of drivers who already have a win picking up more wins, the past 5 races have been unremarkable - and so playoff odds haven't changed much. Of course, the dominance of Harvick and Hamlin has been remarkable to viewers, it's just that the playoff odds don't really care.  

The playoff odds will care about the next few races, however. Entering the last stage of the regular season, the playoff race is heating up. With 8 race winners so far, 8 additional spots are up for grabs. The field is crowded, with roughly 16 drivers in the competition for those spots (by Nascargraphs performance-only playoff odds, 16 drivers have above a 1 in 6 chance at making the playoffs). Aric Almirola leads the pack of non-race winners, but only with a roughly 2 in 3 chance of making the playoffs. We'll see if a Sunday trip to Kentucky Speedway can begin to sort things out.

Notes:

\* In the starkest example of 1-2 battles between dominant drivers, Richard Petty and Bobby Allison alternated 1-2 finishes for 5 consecutive races in August 1971 (Petty winning 3 of the 5) before Allison did not compete in the 1971 Sandlapper 200 (Petty ended up winning that one too).
